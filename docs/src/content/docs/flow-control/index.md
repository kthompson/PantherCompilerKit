title: Flow Control
description: Master conditional logic, loops, and control flow in Panther
---

Control flow structures allow you to control the execution path of your Panther programs based on conditions and repetition.

## Topics

Learn about control flow in Panther:

- **[Conditional Statements](conditional-statements)** - If/else expressions
- **[Loops](loops)** - While and for loops
- **[Pattern Matching](pattern-matching)** - Match expressions

## Quick Example

```panther
val score = 85

if (score >= 90) {
    println("Grade: A")
} else if (score >= 80) {
    println("Grade: B")
} else {
    println("Grade: C")
}
```
